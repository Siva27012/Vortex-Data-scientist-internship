# Vortex Data Scientist Internship

Welcome to the repository documenting my 15-day internship experience at Vortex as a Data Scientist. During this internship, I delved into various aspects of data science, gaining practical experience and skills in Python programming, data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of the tools, techniques, and projects I worked on during my internship. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find:

- **Python**: Proficiency in Python programming language was crucial for the tasks performed throughout the internship. Python provided the foundation for implementing data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning algorithms.
  
- **Libraries**: Utilized key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib extensively for data manipulation, numerical computing, and visualization tasks. These libraries facilitated efficient handling and analysis of datasets.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Explored various data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare datasets for analysis. This involved handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - **Linear Regression**: Implemented linear regression models to analyze the relationship between variables and make predictions.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Utilized SVM for both classification and regression tasks, understanding its flexibility and effectiveness in handling complex datasets.
  - **K-Means**: Explored unsupervised learning techniques, particularly K-Means clustering, for segmenting data into distinct groups based on similarity.
  - **Apriori Algorithm**: Studied association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm to identify patterns in transactional data.
